# Circuit Breaker LLM Integration - Product Enhancement Document

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Overview
This document outlines the architectural redesign of the Circuit Breaker server's agent execution system, transitioning from a GraphQL-based execution model to a RESTful, streaming-first architecture that supports multi-tenancy and proper LLM integration.

### 1.2 Current State Problems
- Agent executions are not properly calling LLMs (zero cost, instant completion)
- Virtual model names are not being resolved before LLM provider calls
- Incorrect payload formats being sent to LLM providers
- Missing parameter filtering for different LLM models
- Poor response extraction and serialization
- GraphQL architecture is unsuitable for streaming and multi-tenant execution
- No proper tenant isolation or security model

### 1.3 Proposed Solution
A complete architectural shift to RESTful endpoints specifically designed for agent execution, with built-in streaming support, multi-tenancy, and proper LLM integration patterns.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture
The new architecture separates concerns between:
- **Agent Management**: GraphQL for CRUD operations
- **Agent Execution**: REST endpoints for execution with streaming support
- **LLM Integration**: Proper virtual model resolution and provider routing
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Tenant-aware execution with proper isolation

### 2.2 Core Components
1. **Agent Execution Router**: Routes execution requests to appropriate handlers
2. **Virtual Model Resolver**: Resolves virtual model names to actual provider models
3. **LLM Provider Gateway**: Handles communication with various LLM providers
4. **Streaming Response Handler**: Manages real-time response streaming
5. **Multi-Tenant Security Layer**: Ensures tenant isolation and authentication
6. **MCP Tools Integration**: Allows agents to use tools and context

## 3. API Specifications

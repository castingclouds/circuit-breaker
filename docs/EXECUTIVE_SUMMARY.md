# Circuit Breaker: The Unified AI Workflow Platform

## Executive Summary

Circuit Breaker represents a paradigm shift from simple LLM API routing to a comprehensive AI workflow orchestration platform. Built in Rust for maximum performance and reliability, it unifies multiple AI infrastructure patterns into a single, secure, and scalable system that goes far beyond traditional LLM routing services.

### Unified Router Architecture Strategy

Circuit Breaker integrates four critical AI infrastructure patterns into one cohesive platform:

1. **LLM Router & Provider Management** - OpenRouter.ai alternative with bring-your-own-key model
2. **Secure MCP Server** - GitHub Apps-style authentication for AI agent coordination  
3. **Project Context Management** - Scoped AI operations within defined project boundaries
4. **Agent Swarm Orchestration** - Multi-agent coordination with workflow state management

This unified approach enables enterprises to deploy sophisticated AI automation while maintaining security, performance, and operational control.

## Market Opportunity

The AI infrastructure market is rapidly evolving beyond simple API proxying toward comprehensive workflow orchestration. Organizations need:

- **Unified AI Platform**: Single system for LLM routing, agent coordination, and workflow management
- **Project-Scoped Intelligence**: AI operations focused within specific repositories and contexts
- **Secure Agent Swarms**: Multiple AI agents working together with proper authentication and audit trails
- **Cross-Service Integration**: Seamless coordination between GitLab, GitHub, and other development tools
- **Enterprise Security**: GitHub Apps-style authentication with fine-grained permissions and session management
- **Real-time Streaming**: Advanced streaming for multi-agent coordination and workflow updates
- **Performance at Scale**: Sub-5ms routing latency with support for thousands of concurrent AI operations

Circuit Breaker addresses all these needs through its unified router architecture, providing a complete AI workflow platform rather than just API routing.
